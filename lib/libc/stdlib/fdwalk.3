.Sh NAME
.Nm fdwalk
.Nd iterate over open file descriptors
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft int
.Fn fdwalk "int (*cb)(void *, int)" "void *cbd"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function walks the list of currently open file descriptors and calls the
.Ar cb
callback function on each descriptor.
The
.Nm
function passes the
.Ar cbd
argument into the callback, along with each file descriptor.
If
.Ar cbd
returns non-zero, iteration over the list is terminated and the return value
from
.Ar cbd
is returned up to the caller as the return value of
.Nm .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
function will return 0 on success, or the return value of the last call to the
callback.
It will also return -1 and set errno on errors in
.Xr sysctl 3 ,
and
.Xr malloc 3 .
No errors are defined for it.
All errors are passed through from
.Xr sysctl 3 ,
.Xr malloc 3
and the callback.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr closefrom 2 ,
.Xr kinfo_getfile 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
function first appeared in SunOS.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
function is potentially not thread safe.
It uses
.Xr malloc 3
and
.Xr sysctl 3
behind the scenes.
It also only takes a snapshot, so any file descriptors created or removed
after the snapshot is taken, either in another thread or in the callback
function, are not handled.
